		~~~HOW TO PLAY~~~
		
		Attributes:
		         - Once you've entered a game, you will begin your 20-step journey through Shelby Hall.
		         - You will have three attributes: intelligence, money (displayed in dollars), and time (displayed in minutes).
		         - If any of these attributes reaches 0 at any point, you lose the game.
		         - If an attribute hits 0 on the same turn that you reach the end, you'll still lose the game; be wary!
		
		Actions:
		         - You can choose to move, read technical papers, pickpocket a passerby, view character stats, or quit the game.
		         - Moving, reading, and pickpocketing will all reduce your remaining time by 1.
		         - However, viewing your character stats will not. Feel free to check your stats often!
		         - Only moving your character will reduce the number of steps needed to reach the end.
		         - If you successfully reach the end, then you win!
		
		Moving:
		         - Moving your character could result in a number of different scenarios.
		         - For example, you could encounter a puzzle in which you need to input the correct answer.
		         - In this case, if you answer the question correctly, you will gain a random amount of a random attribute.
		         - If you answer the question incorrectly, you will lose a random amount of a random attribute.
		         - A number of other things that affect your attributes could also occur; you never know what'll happen!
		         - Be careful and try to make sure that no single attribute is too low, or you might lose the game!
		
		High scores:
		         - Your high score is calculated by multiplying your three attributes together at the end of the game.
		         - If you lose the game, then your high score won't be calculated at all.
		         - If your score is within the top 10, then it will be saved and will be shown on the high scores page.
		
		Good luck, and have fun!
